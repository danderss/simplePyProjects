A repository for simple python projects created as part of my learning journey.
Projects completed from "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"

Contents - 
1. helloWorld.py
    A simple program to ask for the user's name and age. This is then printed to screen, along with their age in a year's time. 
2. rockPaperScissors.py
    Practicing flow control statements. Not the most elegant but it has been good practice for practicing this skill.
